# PostHog interview test

Hey there ğŸ‘‹. We're super happy you've made it this far into the process, and very excited for you to tackle this final challenge.

The idea here is to end up with a functional, if simple, app. We've already set up a basic React frontend and a couple of backend servers to get you started. You don't _have_ to use any of this though, so feel free to use something else entirely.

You can use any languages/libraries/packages you want.

This test is to see if you can scrappily get an MVP up and running within a day. Don't worry too much about code quality, though any calculations over the data should be correct.

At the end of the day, please send us a few lines (over email or Slack) with
- how you approached this task and whether you'd do things differently now
- what you thought of this exercise
- how you would carry on building this if you had another 2 weeks

Package up your directory as a ZIP and post in the Slack channel.

Also, please keep this test to yourself and don't share it with anyone else.

Good luck!


## The challenge

You're an engineer at HedgeHogFlix, the leading movie streaming service for hedgehog related content. There's a dump of raw events, and you want to build a tool that allows anyone in the company to do analysis on that data. It's up to you to figure out what kind of analysis would be useful.


## The data

The data is stored inside of two JSON files in the `/data` folder. One of these, `/data/events.json`, holds every event that's happened. It's an array of objects in this format:

```json
[
    {"event": "user visited home page", "timestamp": "2020-03-20T01:31:12.467113+00:00", "distinct_id": "bbc72ed3-ede2-41d7-aa16-d441f5c19d8b", "properties": {"country": "UK"}},
    {"event": "user watched movie", "timestamp": "2020-03-20T01:31:16.597312+00:00", "distinct_id": "2085", "properties": {"country": "Canada"}}
]
```

- `event` is the type of action the user did. We have a few:
    - user visited home page
    - user visited sign up page
    - user created account
    - user entered credit card
    - user watched movie
- The `distinct_id` is the unique id for this user. If the user is anonymous (ie, they aren't logged in) this will be a UUID. If they are logged in, it will be an integer that corresponds with the account ID in the HedgeHogFlix backend.
- `timestamp` iso format timestamp of when the event occured
- `properties` is an object that can hold any kind key/value pairs. They might store the user's browser, country they're in, their chosen plan etc.

Then there is another file called `/data/users.json`. It's in this format:

```json
[
    {"user_id": "9eea99e5-39e1-482a-8ce9-8848f0bacc42", "distinct_ids": ["bbc72ed3-ede2-41d7-aa16-d441f5c19d8b", "2085"], "properties": {"email": "jane@gmail.com"}},
]
```

- `user_id` is a unique UUID the analytics backend assigns whenever it sees a new distinct_id that isn't already part of another user.
- `distinct_ids` is a list of distinct_ids belonging to this user. A user can have multiple distinct_ids. This happens when originally a user was anonymous (because they were browsing the home page for example) and then decided to sign up. At that point, instead of creating 2 users, HedgeHogFlix's analytics backend will combine the anonymous UUID and the integer from the backend into a single user.
- `properties` is again an object that can hold any kind of key/value pairs.

## Getting started

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
yarn install
yarn start
```

This will open your frontend at http://localhost:3000

### Python

```bash
cd backend/python
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
./start
```

Will run a server on http://localhost:5000.

Black is installed, so if you want you can run `black .` at the end to format your code if it is python.


enable all kinds of analytics

exploration
filters:
- logged in / anon users
- properties
- events
- time series graph


dashboard:
- event funnel per user
- overall funnel flow
- conversion rate (anon -> logged in time)


controller
- combine user and event properties


get user events

data validations
- if user id, then must have email property
- user distinct ids are unique and not nested
